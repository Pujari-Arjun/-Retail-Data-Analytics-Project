Data Analysis
1. Data Exploration: Used SQL queries and Python (pandas, matplotlib,
seaborn, etc) to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.
2. Advanced Analysis: Performed more complex analysis as needed. For
example, time series analysis for sales trends, cohort analysis for
customer behavior, etc. Python's advanced data analysis libraries can
be very usefulled here.
Reporting
1. Report Preparation: Prepared reports summarizing the findings. These can include:
• Tabular Reports: Creating summary tables showing sales by product, store, month, etc. These
can be generated using SQL queries and Python, and then formatted and presented in Excel.
• Visual Reports: Creating visual reports (charts, graphs, etc) showing trends and patterns. These
can be created using Python's data visualization libraries, and then incorporated into Excel for
presentation.
2. Report Presentation: Presented the reports to in either your Excel dashboard or prepare a PPT
to present the findings.
